<h2> The Unshakeable Force of Manav Rachna</h2>

      <p>
        In a world that values speed and flash, one clan stands apart, defined by its deep-rooted strength and unstoppable will. We are the Forest Rhinos, the enduring and powerful foundation of Manav Rachna University.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are the anchors of this universityâ€”unmoved by pressure, undeterred by obstacles. Our power isn't loud; it's self-evident. We embody the spirit of the rhino: a thick skin that makes us resilient, a powerful charge that breaks through any barrier, and a grounded presence that brings stability to our community. We don't chase glory; we earn it through persistence, integrity, and sheer force of will.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Forest Rhinos, we are defined by:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Unstoppable Determination:</strong> When we set a goal, we move towards it with a singular, powerful focus that clears all obstacles from our path. Our momentum is our greatest weapon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unyielding Resilience:</strong> We are mentally tough and emotionally grounded. Pressure and setbacks do not break us; they strengthen our resolve and harden our skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Grounded Strength:</strong> Our success is built on a solid foundation of deep knowledge, unwavering integrity, and powerful mutual support. We are reliable, dependable, and strong.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protective Unity:</strong> A rhino is formidable, but a crash is a fortress. We are fiercely loyal, creating a secure and empowering environment where every member is protected and valued.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="motto-heading">Our Motto:</h3>
      <p className="motto-text">
        <em>Break Through. Stand Strong.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        We are the force that cannot be moved and the momentum that cannot be stopped.
      </p>
