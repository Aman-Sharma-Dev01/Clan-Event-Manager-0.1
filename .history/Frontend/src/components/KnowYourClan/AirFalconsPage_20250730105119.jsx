 <h2>About the Air Falcons Clan: Soaring Above the Horizon of Success</h2>

      <p>
        While some clans prowl the earth and others navigate the seas, one clan claims the endless expanse of the sky. We are the Air Falcons, the masters of altitude and ambition at Manav Rachna University.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are the visionaries, the innovators, and the high-achievers, defined by a perspective that others lack. From our vantage point, we see opportunities first, map the path to success with clarity, and act with decisive speed. Like the majestic falcon, we combine grace with power, executing our plans with a precision that leaves no room for error.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Air Falcons, we are defined by:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Elevated Vision:</strong> We see the bigger picture. Our ability to look ahead allows us to anticipate challenges, identify groundbreaking opportunities, and lead with foresight in our academic and professional pursuits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Swift Execution:</strong> When a goal is in sight, we act with unmatched speed and accuracy. Inspired by the falcon's stoop, we are decisive, focused, and relentless in achieving our objectives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Soaring Ambition:</strong> We refuse to be grounded by mediocrity. We constantly push ourselves to reach greater heights, setting new records in sports, academics, and cultural activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unified Flight:</strong> Though a falcon can rule the sky alone, our strength is magnified when we fly as one. We are a cohesive unit that supports, uplifts, and enables every member to ascend.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="motto-heading">Our Motto:</h3>
      <p className="motto-text">
        <em>See the Goal. Own the Sky.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        We are defined not by the ground we walk on, but by the heights we dare to reach.
      </p>
